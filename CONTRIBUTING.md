## Features

* Spring Boot-based RESTful APIs
* Product and order management functionalities
* MySQL database for persistent data storage
* Integration with Maven for build automation
* Prepared for CI/CD pipeline integration

## Technologies

* Java (JDK 11)
* Spring Boot framework
* MySQL relational database
* Maven build tool
* DevOps tools (CI/CD pipelines, Docker, etc.)

## Prerequisites

Before contributing to the project, ensure you have the following tools installed:

* JDK 11
* Maven
* MySQL
* Git version control system

## DevOps Learning Goals

This project aims to provide hands-on experience with essential DevOps practices:

* **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automate the build and testing process using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
* **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Establish a deployment pipeline to automatically deploy the application to different environments.
* **Docker:** Containerize the application for consistent deployment across various environments.
* **Kubernetes:** Deploy and manage the application in a Kubernetes cluster for container orchestration.
* **Monitoring:** Implement application performance monitoring with tools like Prometheus and Grafana to gain insights into application health and performance.

## Contribution Guidelines

We appreciate your interest in contributing to TP Achat! Here are some guidelines to ensure a smooth contribution process:

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Create a fork of the TP Achat repository on GitHub. This allows you to make your own changes without affecting the original codebase.

2. **Create a Branch:**
   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
   - Create a new branch for your specific contribution using a descriptive naming convention (e.g., `feature/add-new-feature` or `bugfix/fix-issue-123`).

3. **Implement Your Changes:**
   - Make your changes to the relevant code files.
   - Ensure your code adheres to the existing coding style and conventions.
   - Add unit tests for your changes to guarantee their functionality.

4. **Commit Your Changes:**
   - Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages that describe the purpose of your modifications.

5. **Push Your Changes:**
   - Push your committed changes to your forked branch on GitHub.

6. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub and issue a pull request.
   - Provide a detailed description of your changes in the pull request body, explaining the motivation behind your contribution and the addressed issue (if applicable).

7. **Review Process:**
   - Project maintainers will review your pull request and may request modifications or clarifications.
   - Address any feedback promptly to facilitate the merging process.

## Code Style and Conventions

* Adhere to consistent code formatting and indentation for readability.
* Follow the project's existing coding conventions (e.g., naming conventions, variable declarations, etc.).
* If unsure about the coding style, refer to existing code examples or consult with project maintainers.

## Testing

* Write unit tests for your code contributions to ensure their functionality and prevent regressions in future modifications.
* The project may already have existing unit tests. Make sure your changes do not break existing tests and consider adding new tests for your specific contribution.

## Documentation

* If your contribution involves new features or functionalities, consider updating the project documentation to reflect the changes.
* This helps users understand how to use your contribution effectively.

## Additional Notes

* We encourage clear and concise communication when interacting with project maintainers during the review process.
* Feel free to ask questions or seek clarification if anything is unclear.
* We appreciate your contributions to the TP Achat project!
